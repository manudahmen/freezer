Extensions to CDDB Server Protocol implemented by PHP Version

(c) 2006 Massimo Magnano 
-------------------------------------------------------------

AT THIS TIME (Version 0.0.6) THE query_dtitle EXTENSION IS IMPLEMENTED
BUT IN A VERY SLOW MODE, IF YOU USE IT FROM A WEB SERVER YOU CAN GET A
"CGI TIMEOUT" ERROR.... THE WAY TO QUICK IT IS : DO AN INDEX SORTED BY ARTIST/TITLE

Query database for matching Artist e\o Title:
------------------------------------
Client command:
-> cddb query_dtitle categ / artist / title 

    categ:
	    Category or *
	    
    artist:
	    Artist Name  or *
	    
    title:
      Album Title  or *
      
Server response:
<- code categ discid dtitle
	or
<- code close matches found
<- categ discid dtitle
<- categ discid dtitle
<- (more matches...)
<- .

    code:
	200	Found one  match
	210 Found more matches, list follows (until terminating marker)
	202	No match found
	409	No handshake
    categ:
	CD category.  Example: rock
    discid:
	CD disc ID number of the found entry.  Example: f50a3b13
    dtitle:
	The Disc Artist and Disc Title (The DTITLE line).  For example:
	Pink Floyd / The Dark Side of the Moon
 
for example  :
 cddb query_dtitle misc / Pink Floyd / *  -> return all Pink Floyd Albums in misc category
 
WARNING : Is not a good idea to make "query_dtitle * / * / *", it return the entire Database.
          Clients that use this command must increase the timeout value.
